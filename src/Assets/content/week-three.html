        <p>Lazy day at sea, recovering from drinks the night before. We had a departure seminar and then a lovely dinner at the yacht club. A speciality dinner with a fun vibe, we enjoyed reminising about all the lovely staff we had met at sea.</p>

       <p>We continue crossing the South Atlantic ocean towards Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. Wow what a difference today, we woke to calm seas and temperatures in the late teens. After pancakes in the yacht club and some time at the gym for me and a haircut on-board for Ben. We had ou last RAT test on-board, tomorrow we get a PCR test! We staked out a sunny table on deck 5 behind the Azure cafe and spent several hours watching the world float by while enhoying lunch before some jacuzzi and whale watching on the sun deck on level 10. Tonight there is the Captains farewell cocktail function for those departing and likely our final dinner at Koko's.</p>

       <h3>Day 17 ~ Uruguay, 27th March 2022</h3>
       <h4>The Ranch</h4>
       <p>We had an on-board breakfast before beginning our day tour which was actually a real highlight. We went to a working farm where we had a tour, I went on a horse drawn buggy with a new friend Don. Our guide did not speak any english so we made up the tour on our own. We stopped by the river - so wide and spoke to the owners son about kiteboarding. After this we had a lovely lunch with lots of red wine and then Ben went on a 'magic carpet' ride, being dragged across the land behind one of the local ponies.</p>

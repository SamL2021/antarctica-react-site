       <h3>Day 19 ~ Rio, 29th March 2022</h3>
       <h4>Discovering Rio</h4>
       <p>Today we went to see the sights, I organised a driver and guide through the hotel who took us up to see Christ the redeemer, when we arrived the whole statue was shrouded by clouds but we waited patiently for about 20 minutes and the skies opened up, the sun shone and we could see for miles around. The tourists were great fun to watch, waiting and trying to get their own special moment even when there are so many people crowded together. After this we went to sugar loaf Mountain, this is up two steep cable cars but half way we stopped and enjoyed an aperol spritz while looking back at Christ the redemmer and over the beaches that Rio is famous for. We had lunch at a restaurant previously visited by Madonna and after a big day on our feet we went back for a swim and then light dinner at the hotel. Lisa and I also had our final PCR test for the trip.</p>

       <h3>Day 20 ~ Traveling, 30th March 2022</h3>
       <h4>Copacabana Palace</h4>
       <p>Today we planned to relax before our long travels home, my friend Lisa and I took some bikes from the hotel and rode up and down the beach before we met Ben for a leisurely breakfast, Lisa and I then went over for a walk and swim at the beach. We all then spent the afternoon by the pool enjoying the sunshine and more spritz. We had to leave the hotel by 7pm to fly at 11pm.</p>

       <h3>Day 21 ~ Traveling, 31st March</h3>
       <p>We landed into Miami after an overnight flight and parted ways with Ben as he stayed on for work, Lisa and I spent some time in the lounge where I was able to enjoy a shower before our connecting flight to Dallas. We had the whole day in Dallas then flew back to Sydney that night. I really enjoyed flying in Qantas Premium Economy and slept for over 9 hours of the 16 hour flight home ~ Bliss~</p>

        <h2>Buenos Aires</h2>
        <p>
          Our trip begins with two nights in the Sofitel Buenos Aires Recoleta. We planned a private tour to explore as much of Buenos Aires as we could in one day, our local guide Elba meets us at the hotel and she makes sure we see as much of the city as is possible in four hours.

        <h3>Day 1 ~ At Sea, 11th March 2022</h3>
        <p>Board the ship after a short but uncomfortable flight and covid test, prosecco on arrival. Private safety briefing and then taken to our suite 715, bottle of champagne on arrival. Spent some time in the spa then watched the mandatory briefings and had room service before we departed along with the rest of our champagne. Ben was asleep, bed was amazing. During the night we entered the Drake Passage, with a 5m swell and strong winds there was lots of motion in the ocean with up to 6 metre swells.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>The Drake Passage</strong>,  the reputed roughest sea-passage in the world is a deep waterway, 1000 km wide, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans between Cape Horn (the southernmost point of South America) and the South Shetland Islands, situated about 160 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula. It is a most vivid blue, undertones of purple and an almost aqua in the wash of the ship. Giant seabirds like Albatross follow us, cruising behind making use of the updrafts and picking up small marine animals exposed from the choppy waves made by the ship.

        <h3>Day 2 ~ At Sea, 12th March 2022</h3>
        <p>Woke up at 5:30 am so almost changed time zones, coffee at Azure. Breakfast in the yacht club. Stretch before more briefings, decided we'd like to experience the helicopter but skip the submarine. Hit the gym before lunch at Elements. Staff are super friendly, very impressed at the breadth of knowledge and all the regions the discovery team hail from. Woke with a sore eye, saw the on-baord doctor and prescribed drops. Dined on salmon for lunch at Elements, visited the spa had a 3 hour jet lag nap and then awesome sushi at Kokos for dinner (an authentic Japanese experience), probably drank a little too much which is easy to do with the free-flowing drinks.</p>

        <h3>Day 3 ~ At Sea, 13th March 2022</h3>
        <p>Woke up at 4am, nap may have been the culprit or too many drinks. The sea is undulating with a thick mist cover. Sent a quote from my bed for a guest to visit a retreat in Thailand. Trying to remember to soak up all the moments and appreciate the experience, once in a lifetime. Had an incredible hot stone massage on-board.</p>
        <p>Wildlife Checklist: Humpback whale.</p>
        
        <h3>Day 4 ~ Antarctica, 14th March 2022</h3>
        <h4>Excursion: Paddle boarding.</h4>
        <p>Started the day in the gym just after 5, watched icebergs float by as the sun rose. By 9am we had boots on Antartica, followed by a R.A.T test (all the passengers were negative). 12pm we were wine tasting with the sommelier as the ship repositioned for the afternoons excursions. We went stand up paddleboarding with Jordan from Canada, using drysuits. What a unique adventure, we got so close to penguins and a mud eater seal, moving ice to paddle. After we went onto continental Antartica and walked almost amongst the penguins to have our photo taken with the Antarctica flag. Dinner was at Elements, the main dining venue offering a wide variety of Italian cuisine, steak and seafood.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Wildlife Checklist: Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins, Antarctic shag and comorant. Crabeater seal and minke whale. </p>

        <h3>Day 5 ~ Antarctica, 15th March 2022</h3>
        <h4>Excursion: Helicopter Ride!</h4>
        <p>Today we slept until almost 7am, watched another seal playing by the ice before a leisurely breakfast in the Yacht Club, then our first adventure of the day was a helicopter ride and wow did it give us perspective on how HUGE Antarctica is! We had a zodiac cruise where we saw a leopard seal, she was really interested in us and swam around the boat several times, just as we left she popped up right below my husband and opened her mouth in almost a warning, we thought she might jump aboard. We then had another landing in the afternoon where we saw fur seals, a weddell seal, a whale bone grave yard and lots of gentoo penguins and then then we went back for the polar plunge!</p>
        <p>Wildlife Checklist: Weddell, fur and leopard seals.</p>
        
        <p>The water temperature was -1.2 degrees and on land -5 degrees. It was snowing as we waited then once we jumped (my husband and I holding hands) I saw this incredible colour from below, the purple blue then the aqua but the cold was so intense I forgot how to breath, how to swim, how to think. Only in the water for a matter of seconds it was overwhelming, a great experience but also a reminder of the fragility of life. After several shots and a few hours in the jacuzzi we felt human again. Another amazing dinner in Koko's, the Asian Fusion restuarant.</p>

        <h3>Day 6 ~ At Sea, 16th March 2022</h3>
        <p>61o45'S, 055o24'W</p>
        <h2>Today we sail to Elephant Island, where Ernest Shackleton's men famously endured a harsh winter at Point Wild awaiting rescue.</h2>
        <p>Weather: cloudy</p>
        <p>Sunrise 6:20 and sunset 20:52</p>
        <p>Temp: -2 degrees to 2 degrees celsius</p>
        <p>Today we are headed towards Elephant Island. The conditions are wild, somewhere around a Force 10: Storm <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/89174/beaufort-scale"> Beaufort wind scale</a>, with 12 being a Hurricane. The outside temp of -4.5 degrees with winds of 48-50 knots or approximately 90kms/hr</p>
        <p>We have planned for a relaxing day today, making the most of the opportunity to relax on our holiday, the ship is handling the conditions extremely well and as long as we take our sea sickness medication we are able to enjoy the experience though the same cannot be said for all on-board.</p>

        <p>Wildlife Checklist: Fin whale.</p>
        <p>Highlight of the day was watching more than a 100 fin whales lunge feeding alongside the boat as we passed Elephant Island.</p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Elephant Island</h4>
        <p>Elephant Island or “Hell-of-an-Island” is an ice-covered, mountainous island off the coast of Antarctica in the outer reaches of the South Shetland Islands, in the Southern Ocean - famous for hosting members of the Endurance expedition for four months in 1916 while Ernest Shackleton sailed for help</p>

        <h3>Day 7 ~ At Sea, 17th March 2022</h3>

        <h4>Scotia Sea</h4>
        <p>Weather: Cloudy</p>
        <p>Sunrise 6:20 and sunset 20:52</p>
        <p>Another covid test as we arrive into South Georga. Hoping for more whale watching opportunities today. Saw two huge icebergs in the night - incredible especially as it was a full moon and the captain orientated the ship so we could pass them close by and see them under the special ice lights.</p>
